## goconverter
This Go application is a simple file conversion service that runs a web server to accept zip files containing documents. Users can upload zip files through an HTTP POST request to a specified endpoint. The application will then process each document within the zip file, converting it from one format to another using an external tool (pandoc). This service is particularly useful for batch processing of document format conversions.
